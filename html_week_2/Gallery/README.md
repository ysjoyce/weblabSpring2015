#Rogues Gallery

Using the images in the 'img' directory, create a gallery page that displays all the images along with a name for the avatar and a link to their twitter page.  All images are named with the avatar's twitter handle.

If the developer wishes, names can be generated from a tool at http://uinames.com.
